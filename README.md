# NumPy Learning
This repo contains my learning journey with NumPy. All practice files are organized by topic.


## Topics Covered

- Creating 1D and 2D arrays
- NumPy vs Python list performance
- Array creation from scratch (`zeros`, `ones`, `full`, `random`, `arange`)
- Vectors, Matrices, and Tensors
- Array properties (`shape`, `size`, `ndim`, `dtype`)
- Array reshaping, flattening, and raveling
- Transpose of arrays

## How to Run

Make sure you have Python and NumPy installed:

```bash
pip install numpy
